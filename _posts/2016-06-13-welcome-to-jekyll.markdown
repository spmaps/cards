JustMap is an ongoing collaborative map based on public workshops organised at neighbourhood festivals or specific community events.

Its goal is to highlight communities assets and projects, connect actors campaigning for a fairer London and identify strategic cooperations.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
